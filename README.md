###Blog

Three is the third iteration of my personal domain, [tonigemayel.com](http://tonigemayel.com). Its minimal, simple & clean. Its perfect for users who include hero images with their blog posts. It runs on [Anchor CMS](http://anchorcms.com), a super-simple, lightweight blog system. 

###Credit

Styles from this blog based off of [Michael De Graafs](https://github.com/michieldegraaf/blog) blog with some custom styles of my own.
